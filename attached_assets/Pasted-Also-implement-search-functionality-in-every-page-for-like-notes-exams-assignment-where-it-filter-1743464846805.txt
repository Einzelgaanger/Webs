Also, implement search functionality in every page for like notes/exams, assignment, where it filters the searched words in the titles and descriptions of the specific page(say notes)s in that page in that unit only, 
Also, the onboarding looks very boring, make it a bit more lively and animated, same with the splash screen, and also make a more advanced favicon, the current one looks so simple
also, decorate the pages such as the auth one, the onboarding etc, with better icons, or even pictures at some point
also, for the login tip on onboarding, tell them if their name in the class register is  Max, James Bond, they should ignore Max and put James Bond as their name, also tell them to changet heir paaword immediately they login
Also, in the mainpage, where wwe have dashboard, the units on the left, profile and signout, at the very bottom, put somethign about me, like to acknowledge the developer, where if someone click they will be redirected to my ig profile so that means we put a link behind the button

also, my nickname is 
𝐌𝐚𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐜𝐤
So put it there with that exact font
Also, the marking assigng assignmt as done in laptop has a bad ui ux design, so make sure it is an icon instead of words, like the one for phone, but also put a confirmation popup

also, for all pages, when someone is putting their password, they should be able to  see it or not, as they wish, using the eye icon so that they see what they are puttong
also, one cannot upload past papers like the way we upload notes, i have attatched the error message
then last but not least,for the details in the dashboard under upcoming deadlines, i should be able to just click on one of them then i immediately redirected to the specific unit in that specific page
then make the website more colourful, the while is too much, use bright colours and also brighter blues than the one you are using etc, so that the final ui ux will be colourful
Now debug all that
